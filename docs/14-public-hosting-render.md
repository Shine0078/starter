# Public Hosting Without VPN or Tailscale

`render.yaml` and `Dockerfile.public` provide a single-service deployment for
FINVERSE on Render:

- the API and Flutter PWA run in one public HTTPS service;
- the PWA uses same-origin API calls;
- managed PostgreSQL persists data while the owner's computer is offline;
- Render supplies restart/redeploy behavior and the public HTTPS hostname.

This is different from a tunnel: the app does not depend on this workstation,
Tailscale, a home router, or a phone being on the same network.


## Current Deployment Status (verified 2026-08-18)

**`https://finverse.onrender.com` is live but is not running this API.** It is
serving an unrelated placeholder Express app:

```text
GET https://finverse.onrender.com/        -> 200  "You have requested the home route with GET"
GET https://finverse.onrender.com/healthz -> 404  Cannot GET /healthz
```

Response headers show `x-powered-by: Express` with no NestJS routes and no
`/api` surface. The first request took 31 s, which is the free-tier cold start,
so the service is awake — it is running the wrong deploy.

Consequence: the public PWA at `https://shine0078.github.io/starter/app/`
renders correctly but **cannot authenticate**. A request to `/api/auth/login`
from that origin fails, and the user sees "Couldn't reach the server. Check your
connection."

### Owner action

Point the Render service at this repository's Blueprint (`render.yaml`, steps
below), or delete the service and recreate it from the Blueprint.

### Verify with `/healthz`, never with `/`

The placeholder answers `GET /` with a 200, which is precisely why the
misdeploy went unnoticed. A 200 on `/` proves only that *something* is running.

Correct check — `/healthz` must return 200 with a JSON body naming the store:

```bash
curl -sS -w '\nhttp=%{http_code}\n' https://<service>.onrender.com/healthz
```

Then confirm the app shell and that the API is the same origin:

```bash
curl -sS -o /dev/null -w 'app=%{http_code}\n' https://<service>.onrender.com/app/
```

A 404 on `/healthz` means the wrong application is deployed, regardless of what
`/` returns.
## Owner Steps

1. Create a Render account and connect the GitHub repository.
2. Create a Blueprint from the repository. Render reads `render.yaml`.
3. For an immediate preview, keep the Blueprint's **Free** web and Postgres
   plans. Render will not require a payment card. Free web services sleep after
   inactivity and free Postgres expires after 30 days, so upgrade both to
   `Starter`/`Basic` before accepting real users. Free Render does not support
   deployment hooks, so this preview applies migrations at API startup. The
   Blueprint deliberately runs this free preview with `NODE_ENV=development`,
   Sandbox/no real bank data, and the development email adapter; it is not a
   production deployment.
4. After the database is created, copy its internal connection string and set
   `DATABASE_APP_URL` to the same host/database with username `finverse_app`
   and a new strong password. The pre-deploy migration creates that restricted
   role from `DATABASE_URL`.
5. Set `CORS_ORIGINS` to the final service origin, for example
   `https://finverse.onrender.com`.
6. For production, change `NODE_ENV` to `production`, change
   `MIGRATE_ON_BOOT` to `false`, run
   `node dist/infra/postgres/migrate.js` as a separate deployment step, and
   supply reviewed HTTPS Terms and Privacy URLs/version IDs, SMTP credentials,
   `MFA_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, and `BANK_TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY`.
7. Deploy and verify:

```text
https://<service>.onrender.com/healthz
https://<service>.onrender.com/app/
```

8. Set Plaid production credentials only after Plaid approves the account.
Register the webhook and web redirect URLs using the final Render hostname.
9. Build native clients with that public origin:

```powershell
flutter build apk --release --dart-define=API_BASE_URL=https://<service>.onrender.com
```

For iOS, configure the same origin in Xcode and complete Apple Universal Link
registration. The PWA works from Safari immediately after the Render deploy.

## Plaid Sandbox Testing

The CIBC screen is Plaid Sandbox. Use Plaid's documented Sandbox credentials,
not a real card number or real bank password:

```text
username: user_good
password: pass_good
```

Sandbox data is synthetic and must not be presented as real bank connectivity.

## Current Limitation

This repository can generate the deployment image and Blueprint, but it cannot
create the Render account, accept billing/legal terms, or supply production
secrets. Those are the exact remaining owner actions.

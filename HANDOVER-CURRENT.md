# FINVERSE — CURRENT HANDOVER (for the next agent)

> ## 2026-08-15 takeover audit — this supersedes stale statements below
>
> A fresh agent re-ran the complete verification suite against the actual
> repository (branch `main`, commit `9a7898b` + the takeover commits, clean
> working tree at start). Nothing below the previous handovers was trusted
> without evidence.
>
> **Re-measured on this workstation (2026-08-15):**
>
> - `npm test` (API in-memory): **487 passed, 5 Postgres-only skips** (49.5 s).
> - `npm run test:db` (real embedded PostgreSQL incl. the full RLS suite):
>   **596 passed** (55.9 s).
> - `npm run typecheck --workspace @finverse/api`: clean.
> - `npm run build --workspace @finverse/api`: clean.
> - `npm run load:smoke` (memory adapter): 250 requests, concurrency 10,
>   **0 failures, p95 117.3 ms, p99 172.1 ms** (ceiling 750 ms).
> - `flutter analyze`: clean; `flutter test`: **94 passed**.
> - `flutter build web --release --no-web-resources-cdn --base-href=/app/`:
>   built; served from the compiled API on an isolated port with `/app/`, a
>   deep route (GET returns the shell, 200), bootstrap, local CanvasKit
>   JS+Wasm, and the migration worker all 200/no-cache.
> - `flutter build apk --release`: 87.0 MB APK via the intentional
>   debug-signing fallback (upload keystore remains an owner secret).
> - **Plaid Sandbox credentials verified live**: a `link_token/create` call
>   against `https://sandbox.plaid.com` succeeded with the local `.env` keys
>   (never printed, never committed). Provider error mapping in
>   `banking.service.ts` returns actionable per-platform messages.
>
> **Changes made during the takeover:**
>
> - Localized the previously hardcoded English dashboard dialogs and controls
>   (sign-out confirm, account-deletion confirm, verify-email dialog, app-bar
>   tooltips, account popup menu), the app-lock gate, the secure-storage retry
>   screen, and the analytics timeline kind labels — English + French, with a
>   delegate-free English fallback for isolated embedders. New French widget
>   regression included (94th test).
> - `Dockerfile.public` (the Render image) now builds the web bundle with
>   `--no-web-resources-cdn`, matching CI and `release.yml`; the public image
>   previously could fetch the renderer from gstatic even though the bootstrap
>   pins local CanvasKit.
> - Docs re-synced to reality: `07-session-notes.md`, `08-what-blocks-selling.md`,
>   `12-mission2-audit.md` now carry the 487/596/94 evidence and 2026-08-15
>   measurements.
>
> **Verified as still true:** production refuses the in-memory store and
> boot-time migrations; the mock-aggregator `/api/sync` route is refused for
> every persistent Postgres deployment and in production (MockAggregator can
> only feed the in-memory demo); no secrets/keystores are tracked by git.
>
> **Still open and external (unchanged):** the live tunnel from §1 is dead
> (nothing listens on port 3000 after the reboot; in-memory data was lost by
> design). Physical iPhone Safari/Chrome-on-iOS verification of the PWA has
> still never happened — after any deploy, reload the current URL twice (or
> clear Website Data) and confirm onboarding renders; only then close that
> gate. Everything in §8 (domain/hosting, Plaid production, Apple/Mac, push
> credentials, legal/Stripe, pen-test) remains owner action.
>
> ## 2026-08-11 continuation — supersedes stale statements below
>
> - Latest UI/deployment commits: `8960fa0` simplifies the dashboard into a
>   responsive 2x2 financial summary and replaces spinner-only loading states
>   on transaction, budget, goal, subscription, notification, and account
>   screens with shared skeletons. The full Flutter suite now has **93 passing
>   tests** and analysis is clean.
> - Commit `8d56799` adds the permanent public-hosting path: `render.yaml`,
>   `Dockerfile.public`, and `docs/14-public-hosting-render.md`. It deploys the
>   API and Flutter PWA together behind Render HTTPS with managed PostgreSQL;
>   no VPN, Tailscale, home PC, or tunnel is required. A one-click Render
>   button is in `README.md`. The deployment itself is not yet created because
>   the owner must authorize Render and enter secrets/legal settings.
> - The current owner-facing Plaid Sandbox CIBC test values are `user_good` /
>   `pass_good`, not a real card number or real bank password. Sandbox MFA is
>   commonly `1234`. See `docs/11-run-on-your-phone.md`.
>
> - Commit `9c713f3` localizes transaction-row status badges and the category
>   correction menu, including the common quick categories in English and
>   French. Flutter analysis is clean and all **92** tests pass.
> - Commit `c107e6a` localizes plan state, tier comparison, entitlements,
>   checkout/manage flows, payment warnings, and upgrade sheets. It also fixes
>   a real isolated-host crash caused by uninitialized explicit intl date data:
>   date labels now use Flutter's locale-aware `MaterialLocalizations` API.
>   All **92** Flutter tests pass and analysis is clean. A fresh
>   `flutter build web --release --no-web-resources-cdn --base-href=/app/`
>   and Android debug APK build pass after the full localization set. Android
>   still warns that `workmanager_android` must adopt Flutter's future built-in
>   Kotlin model; this is a third-party upgrade watch item, not a current build
>   failure.
> - Commit `0a1898f` localizes the support and recovery centre, including
>   privacy-safe diagnostics and all troubleshooting content. It adds the
>   shared fallback used by recovery screens when an isolated host omits app
>   localization delegates, plus a French regression. All **92** Flutter tests
>   pass and analysis is clean.
> - Commit `6074da0` localizes the transaction explorer and its complete
>   filter sheet: search, empty/error states, status and recurrence filters,
>   range validation, and locale-aware date labels. Flutter analysis is clean
>   and all **91** mobile tests pass.
> - Commit `9497e6c` localizes the complete bank-account management path:
>   Plaid step-up, link/reconnect/disconnect, manual accounts, provider error
>   recovery, plan-limit messaging, status labels, and account card actions.
>   It adds a French regression test. Flutter analysis is clean, all **91**
>   mobile tests pass, and a fresh local-CanvasKit release-web build succeeds.
> - Commit `048f48d` localizes sign-in, account creation, MFA, password
>   recovery, legal-consent, and secure-session messaging in English and
>   French. The login screen safely falls back to English when embedded without
>   localization delegates, which preserves the isolated authentication test
>   harnesses. Flutter analysis is clean and all **90** mobile tests pass.
> - Working tree status at handover: all product changes are committed; this
>   handover file is deliberately untracked and local-only.
>
> - PWA recheck after the later mobile work: a freshly built current API on an
>   isolated port served `/app/`, a deep link, local CanvasKit JS/Wasm, and the
>   source-owned migration worker as 200/no-cache. Its final bootstrap loader
>   call supplies only `canvasKitBaseUrl: 'canvaskit/'`; Flutter's bundled
>   loader source legitimately contains the string `serviceWorkerSettings`, so
>   do **not** use a broad text search as evidence of registration. The
>   existing public quick tunnel has the corrected bootstrap but still runs the
>   old in-memory API process and therefore serves its earlier migration worker
>   without `event.waitUntil`. It was intentionally not restarted, preserving
>   its live in-memory data. Physical iPhone proof remains outstanding.
> - Commit `02bec35` localizes all first-run onboarding pages and actions.
>   Flutter analysis and all **90** mobile tests pass.
> - Commit `9f05508` localizes the Analytics screen's time-range controls,
>   loading/error/empty states, metrics, spending-pace explanations,
>   insight evidence, subscription summary and priority chips. Flutter
>   analysis and all **90** mobile tests pass; fresh release-web and Android
>   debug builds also pass.
> - Commit `54df54a` localizes the shared cash-flow planner’s forecast,
>   purchase scenario controls, forecast chart semantics, and recurring-event
>   panel. It also applies the active locale to the date shown by the purchase
>   picker. Flutter analysis and all **90** mobile tests pass.
> - Commit `95bca4a` localizes monthly-budget creation/removal and savings-goal
>   creation/contributions in English and French. Flutter analysis and all
>   **90** mobile tests pass after this batch.
> - Commit `5bea2a6` localizes subscription insights and the full cash-flow
>   calendar, including locale-aware dates and spoken calendar labels. The
>   existing calendar widget test now hosts real localization delegates. Full
>   Flutter test (**90 passing**), release web, and Android debug builds pass.
>   Android warns that the third-party `workmanager_android` plugin must adopt
>   Flutter's future built-in Kotlin model; current builds remain successful.
> - Commit `f20a392` moves the private finance guide, notifications and device
>   alert preferences, and saved merchant-rule management onto generated
>   English/French strings. It adds a French UI regression test for the guide.
>   The complete Flutter suite now has **90 passing tests**; analysis and a
>   fresh release web bundle pass.
> - Commit `1e54af3` localizes the Profile hub's visible headings, navigation
>   destinations, sign-out control, and verification confirmation in English
>   and French. Flutter analysis is clean and the complete Flutter test suite
>   has **89 passing tests**.
> - Commit `46ee91a` adds a persisted, user-selectable display language:
>   device default, English, or French. The preference restores *after*
>   `runApp`, uses the guarded web shared-preferences registration, and cannot
>   delay the first frame. Settings shows the selector and explicitly discloses
>   that some screens are still being translated; this is **not** a claim that
>   full AppLocalizations adoption is complete. Five new controller/scope
>   regression tests pass; the full Flutter suite now has **89 passing tests**.
> - **PWA startup follow-up (commit `39e435f`):**
>   the generated Flutter 3.44 release bootstrap still chose
>   `https://www.gstatic.com/flutter-canvaskit/<engine-revision>/` by default.
>   The previous local-asset checks therefore did not prove that the renderer
>   needed for the first frame was reachable on an iPhone. A custom
>   `web/flutter_bootstrap.js` now forces `canvaskit/` relative to `/app/`, and
>   the release/CI commands use `--no-web-resources-cdn` as a second guard.
> - Fresh FINVERSE bundles now **do not register a service worker**. A small
>   source-owned `web/flutter_service_worker.js` remains only to migrate older
>   Flutter cache-first clients: it clears every cache, unregisters itself, and
>   uses `event.waitUntil` so Safari cannot terminate cleanup early. Both the
>   API static host and public Nginx host serve that same file; no host-specific
>   interception remains.
> - This code path was verified against a fresh release bundle and an isolated
>   compiled API on port 3011: `/app/`, a deep route, the bootstrap, migration
>   worker, CanvasKit JS/Wasm all returned 200 with `Cache-Control: no-cache`;
>   bootstrap selected local CanvasKit and its final loader call had no service
>   worker registration. Flutter analysis, all 84 Flutter tests, all 475
>   in-memory API tests, API typecheck/build, and a new Android debug APK pass.
> - **Still not physical-iPhone proof.** After deploying this commit, test the
>   current HTTPS URL in Safari and Chrome-on-iOS. For an origin that previously
>   cached the broken build, remove its Safari Website Data or reload once to
>   let the migration worker run, then reload again. Do not call the loading
>   issue resolved until FINVERSE onboarding visibly renders on the phone.
> - The permanent iPhone PWA splash was reproduced as a **pre-first-frame
>   Flutter exception**, not a service-worker or API failure: Flutter 3.44 did
>   not register `shared_preferences_web`, while `ApiClient` constructed
>   `SharedPreferencesAsync` during startup. Commit `8e29c8a` adds an
>   idempotent web registration before session construction. A fresh public
>   Chromium load now reaches FINVERSE onboarding with an empty console.
> - This is **not physical-iPhone proof**. The owner must reload the current
>   tunnel on Safari and Chrome-on-iOS and report whether onboarding appears;
>   do not claim that gate closed until then. The original live-link details
>   below may no longer be current after a restart.
> - Commit `54c06c3` adds required-production HIBP k-anonymity password
>   screening. It is implemented and targeted API tests/build pass.
> - Commit `cf603bb` adds `FcmHttpV1PushProvider`: built-in Node
>   service-account OAuth, FCM delivery for Android/web and APNs-routed iOS,
>   privacy-safe lock-screen payloads, confirmed-stale-token cleanup, and
>   fail-closed configuration. `FCM_CREDENTIALS_JSON` remains an owner secret.
> - The same commit adds `workmanager` network-constrained
>   background bank refresh, iOS BGTask/UIScene plugin registration, and three
>   policy tests. `flutter analyze` and the targeted scheduler tests pass; a
>   fresh Android debug APK was built. The FCM delivery adapter (4 tests) and
>   push API (4 tests) also pass.
> - Commit `140b55a` adds a bounded, explainable learner trained
>   solely from the current user's explicit manual category corrections. Rules
>   and the merchant lexicon still win; conflicting or weak examples predict
>   nothing. The API suite now has 475 passing tests (5 intentional database
>   skips); Flutter has 84 passing tests, analysis is clean, and fresh web
>   release / Android release-mode builds both succeed (the local release uses
>   the project's intentional debug-signing fallback, not a sellable store key).
> - Commit `f2188b0` adds direct private receipt-photo OCR:
>   Android's bundled ML Kit and iOS Apple Vision return a transcript for user
>   review, then only that text is uploaded. Android compiles; Windows cannot
>   compile or physical-test the iOS Vision path.
> - Commit `fd104ac` localizes every new receipt scan/review action in the
>   shipped English and French ARB catalogs. The 84-test Flutter suite and
>   analysis remain clean after this change.
> - Commit `a8dce16` adds an interaction-level accessibility regression that
>   verifies the receipt scan and paste choices expose spoken labels.
> - Commit `f9f8877` aligns the architecture, ADR, roadmap, and selling audit
>   with the correction learner and local receipt-image OCR; previous Phase-2
>   placeholder wording is no longer current.

The only intentional uncommitted file is this handover note itself.

Read this whole file before touching anything. It is the current, verified state as of the last session —
not a promise, and the loading issue at the end is **unresolved and the top priority**.

## 1. Live test link (iPhone, right now)

**`https://drums-lasting-marine-toolbox.trycloudflare.com`**

How it is served right now (all of this dies if the PC sleeps/reboots, and the URL regenerates on tunnel restart):

| Piece | Process | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Cloudflare quick tunnel (no account) | `cloudflared.exe` in `%TEMP%\opencode` | public HTTPS → localhost:3000 |
| FINVERSE API (`npm run dev`, ts-node) | `node.exe` on port 3000 | `STORE=memory` — **data resets on restart** |
| Flutter web PWA | built at `apps/mobile/build/web`, served at `/app/` | same-origin API calls, no `API_BASE_URL` define |

Verified live through the tunnel: `/healthz` 200, `/app/` 200, `/api/legal` 200, `/api/categories` 200, `main.dart.js` 200 and contains **no** placeholder host.

The PC-side firewall allows TCP 3000 (`FINVERSE dev 3000` rule, added with elevation).

**How to reach the same app away from this PC (owner gate, not code):** deploy `infra/docker-compose.public.yml` (Caddy auto-HTTPS) on any VPS with a domain. The repo is fully ready; a domain + hosting account are the only missing pieces.

---

## 2. THE OPEN ISSUE — iPhone web app stuck on the loading splash (top priority)

**Original symptom:** On the iPhone (Safari), opening the link showed forever:

> **FINVERSE — Still loading. The first open downloads the app; later ones are cached.**

That text is Flutter web's default boot splash. It only disappears after `main()` runs and the first frame renders. Server-side is verified healthy (see §1) — every asset returns 200 and the bundle is the fresh same-origin build.

**What is now fixed in source (commits `8e29c8a` and `39e435f`):**
- `SharedPreferencesAsync` is registered before startup on web, eliminating the
  original pre-first-frame Dart exception.
- The release bootstrap explicitly loads CanvasKit from `/app/canvaskit/`, not
  `gstatic.com`; CI and release builds use `--no-web-resources-cdn` as a second
  guard. The public tunnel was rechecked after the build and its bootstrap has
  the local config, `useLocalCanvasKit`, and **no** fresh worker registration.
- New bundles ship a source-owned, migration-only worker which removes stale
  Flutter caches with `event.waitUntil`, then unregisters. Fresh loads use no
  service worker. App static files revalidate with `Cache-Control: no-cache`.

**Live-tunnel caveat:** the API already running on port 3000 was intentionally
not restarted because it holds in-memory test data. It serves the new static
bootstrap (so an uncached iPhone takes the corrected startup path), but its
old in-process worker handler still returns the earlier 240-byte cleanup script
and `no-store` response headers. Restart it only when nobody is testing, to
make the live tunnel match the compiled `39e435f` API exactly.

**One-time recovery step for a previously broken phone:** remove Website Data
for the tunnel/domain (or reload twice). The first navigation lets an old
bootstrap fetch the migration worker; the second navigation runs the new
self-contained bootstrap.

**Remaining hypotheses if it still fails after a clean double-reload (next agent must check in this order):**

1. **iOS Safari version vs modern JS output.** Flutter 3.44 compiles to ES2022+; an older iOS (<16.4-ish) Safari can fail to parse `main.dart.js`, which manifests exactly as an eternal boot splash. **Action:** ask the user's iOS version; have them open the same URL in **Chrome (iOS)** — if Chrome loads fine, it is Safari-version incompatibility.
2. **iPhone Website Data still holds a cached copy.** Settings → Safari → Advanced → Website Data → delete the `trycloudflare` entry. Equivalent to clearing site data.
3. **A startup exception in `main()` on web.** Suspects: `flutter_secure_storage` on web (needs a secure context — we have HTTPS, so unlikely), or `SecureOnboardingStore`/`SecureAppLockStore` reads. Note: these run *after* the first frame, so a stuck splash is more likely (1) or (2) than (3).
4. **Definitive diagnosis:** serve a debug/profile web build (`flutter run -d web-server --web-port 8080` then tunnel it) and read the browser console; or attach Safari Web Inspector from a Mac.

**Do not claim this issue fixed until the user confirms the app renders on their phone.**

## 3. What the product is

FINVERSE — AI-assisted personal finance (Plaid-backed bank sync, budgets, goals, insights, health score, cash-flow forecast, subscriptions, alerts, PDF/CSV exports, privacy/consent, billing). NestJS API + PostgreSQL + Flutter (Android/iOS/web PWA). Pure-domain rule (ADR-0002); ports/adapters everywhere; row-level security in Postgres (ADR-0006).

## 4. State of the four original user complaints

1. **iPhone needs no VPN/Tailscale** — release builds reject loopback origins; physical phones use public HTTPS; same-Wi-Fi dev via `apps/mobile/run-ios-lan.ps1`. Code done; the real iPhone gate is a deployed domain.
2. **Auth/session persistence** — atomic refresh-token rotation (server + store contract), offline-cached reads during refresh outages, keystore-tolerant rotation, tombstone logout. Tests green.
3. **Bank connections / transaction sync** — Plaid Sandbox verified end-to-end; stale in-memory sync-lock recovery; dashboard survives a failed bank sync; reconnect/revoke/webhook/pending→posted flows complete.
4. **Stability/UX** — friendly error messages across all screens, skeletons/empty/error states, offline cache + mutation queue, localization (en+fr), accessibility semantics checks.

## 5. Features completed in the last sessions (all tested, committed)

- `59e66da` config-test isolation from local Plaid Sandbox env bleed
- `c7a1f83` **atomic refresh-token rotation** + concurrent-refresh regression test
- `765edcb` recover stale in-memory bank-sync locks
- `c59533b` iPhone connectivity made explicit (loopback rejection, diagnostics, `run-ios-lan.ps1`, docs)
- `0cce4f1` serve encrypted cached reads when refresh is offline
- `7b2cf04`/`c9ad46c`/`8178266`/`6a67e02` docs + counts synced to reality
- `b301ffc` dashboard stays usable when a bank sync fails
- `3451ec7` `friendlyErrorMessage()` applied across all screens
- `1ad8582` merchant lexicon expanded ~3× (US/CA merchants, streaming, gaming, insurers, telecoms, airlines)
- `107cd6a`/`91bbfc5` localization: `gen_l10n`, English + French ARB, wired through shell/login/offline banner
- `08c656f` **receipt OCR**: pure parser + provider port + `POST/PUT/GET /api/receipts/*` + RLS + mobile attach flow (images never uploaded)
- `ff90f53` + `1212638` **passkeys (WebAuthn)**: pure-Node FIDO2 verifier (challenge, registration/login verify, ES256, sign-counter regression), CBOR/COSE parsing, credential store with RLS, domain-gated config; **push registration**: `POST/DELETE /api/push/device` + failing-closed provider port
- `6e579fb` mobile passkey + push client protocol
- `2e630c9` automated spoken-label accessibility assertion on nav
- `23c9eac` **no-op service worker + no-store for the PWA bundle** (the loading-splash fix)

## 6. Test / build state (last verified)

- API in-memory: **475 passed** (5 Postgres-only skips) · `npm test`
- API + PostgreSQL: **564 passed** · `npm run test:db` (migrations 001–019, RLS, deletion-purge all covered)
- Flutter: **90 passed**, `flutter analyze` clean
- API `npm run build` + `npm run typecheck`: pass
- `flutter build apk --debug`, `flutter build web --release --no-web-resources-cdn --base-href=/app/`: pass
- Load smoke: 0 failures, p95 well under 750 ms

## 7. Local environment facts

- Flutter: `C:\Users\samue\development\flutter` (3.44.9 stable)
- Android SDK: `C:\Users\samue\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk`; Java JDK 21 at `C:\Program Files\Android\openjdk\jdk-21.0.8`
- Local Postgres: `npm run db:start` → `localhost:55432` (`finverse` / `finverse_app` roles), data in `apps/api/.postgres-data`
- `.env` has Plaid **Sandbox** keys (ignored by git). `THROTTLE_DISABLED=true` in dev.
- iOS native builds require macOS/Xcode (CI compiles iOS without signing on macOS).

## 8. External blockers (owner actions — code cannot complete these)

1. Domain + VPS/hosting → deploy `infra/docker-compose.public.yml` → removes the "PC must be on" dependency and gives a permanent HTTPS URL (this is the only real fix for "use it away from this device").
2. Plaid production approval (+ Google identity verification to allowlist `com.finverse.finance` on Android).
3. Apple Developer + Mac/Xcode: signing, Universal Link (`PLAID_IOS_REDIRECT_URI` + `IOS_TEAM_ID` + AASA), physical iOS test, native passkey ceremony.
4. Push delivery: FCM/APNs credentials behind `ports/push.ts`.
5. Legal review (Terms/Privacy versions), Stripe live keys, app-store accounts, penetration test.

## 9. Recommended next milestone for the next agent

**Resolve the iPhone loading splash definitively** (order: iOS version + Chrome test → clear site data → console via debug web build). Then, with owner credentials, deploy the public stack — that single step fulfils the user's "works away from this device" requirement. Do not restart the running API casually: it wipes the in-memory test data and, if `cloudflared` is also restarted, the live URL changes (the next agent should restart both only when the owner is not mid-test, and should document the new URL).
